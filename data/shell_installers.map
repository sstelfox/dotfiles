# Mapping file between my common higher level shell installer names and the specific details
# required to pull in and run the installer for curl | shell download sources.
#
# The format of this file consists of a an alpha-numeric key, as well as hyphens, periods, and
# underscores. Following the key is one or more space characters (to allow for columnar alignment)
# and a pipe delimited set of arguments needed to download, verify, and run the installers with
# my preferred arguments.
#
# If the specific installer needs packages before this is run they need to be handled elsewhere but
# usually these are fairly self-sufficient.
#
# Format: name url|sha256|default_args
