# Takes a binary name along with an architecture and maps it to the github repo, a pinned version,
# post-processing steps, and a file that will be used as the binary and placed within the user's
# path. Optionally takes a sha256 hash to validate the binary is valid.
#
# The format of this file consists of a an alpha-numeric key, as well as hyphens, periods, and
# underscores, one or more space characters followed by an architecture (either amd64 or arm64),
# one or more spaces and finally a pipe delimited set of arguments.
#
# Ex: https://github.com/cilium/hubble/releases/download/v1.16.3/hubble-linux-amd64.tar.gz -> hubble
# Format: name arch username/repo|tag|filename|sha256
#
# Note: For binaries on macOS (not that this file supports that yet) we also need to remove the
# quarantine flag. I should only do this if the sha256 value was specified and matches:
#
# xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/.dotfiles/in_path/bin/age-plugin-fido2-hmac
