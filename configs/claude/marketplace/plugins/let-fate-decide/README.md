# let-fate-decide

A Claude Code skill that draws Tarot cards using `secrets` to inject
entropy into vague or underspecified planning decisions.

## What It Does

When a prompt is sufficiently ambiguous, or the user explicitly invokes fate,
this skill shuffles a full 78-card Tarot deck using cryptographic randomness
and draws 4 cards (which may appear reversed). Claude then interprets the
spread and uses the reading to inform its approach.

## Triggers

- Vague or ambiguous prompts where multiple reasonable approaches exist
- "I'm feeling lucky", "let fate decide", "dealer's choice", "surprise me", "whatever you think", "YOLO"
- Casual delegation ("whatever", "up to you", "your call", "idk", "just do something", "wing it", "I trust you", "doesn't matter", "do what you want", "I don't care", "any approach works", "you pick")
- Yu-Gi-Oh references ("heart of the cards", "I believe in the heart of the cards", "you've activated my trap card", "it's time to duel")
- Shrug-like brevity -- very short prompts that fully delegate the decision
- About to arbitrarily pick between 2+ valid approaches (draw cards instead)
- "Try again" on a system with no actual changes (redraw)

## How It Works

1. A Python script uses `secrets` to perform a Fisher-Yates shuffle
2. 4 cards are drawn from the top of the shuffled deck
3. Each card has an independent 50% chance of being reversed
4. Claude reads the drawn cards' meaning files and interprets the spread
5. The interpretation informs the planning direction

## Card Organization

Each of the 78 Tarot cards has its own markdown file:

- `cards/major/` - 22 Major Arcana (The Fool through The World)
- `cards/wands/` - 14 Wands (Ace through King)
- `cards/cups/` - 14 Cups (Ace through King)
- `cards/swords/` - 14 Swords (Ace through King)
- `cards/pentacles/` - 14 Pentacles (Ace through King)
