# Create Semgrep Rule

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

This command is context-driven. Use conversation context to understand:
1. The vulnerability or pattern to detect
2. The target language
3. Whether taint mode is appropriate

If context is unclear, ask for a description of the pattern to detect.

Invoke the `semgrep-rule-creator` skill for the full workflow.
