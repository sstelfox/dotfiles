# I make use of a global hook directory by default. This tries to passthrough to any configured
# hooks to the repo's specific hooks if they're configured.

## Useful Tip:
##
## I can check what the currently applied config is and where the config items are coming from by
## running the following command while in a directory I want to check the config for (such as a
## specific repo):
##
## git config --list --includes --show-origin


## These are all the settings I previously left as defaults. They'll probably almost all come in here
## but I want to get creative where I'm overriding custom tool calls and other areas where there may
## be a system constraint, or configuration conflict.
